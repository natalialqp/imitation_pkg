# Role of Google Protocol Buffer in Kortex API 

The Kortex API uses Google Protocol Buffer message objects<sup>**[1](#useful-links)**</sup> to exchange data between client and server.  

Google Protocol Buffer offers structured data objects with standard methods for each member field:  
+ structured, nested objects
+ basic types and collections
+ getter/setter methods on basic types
+ iterators, dimension and appending methods on collections
+ many helpers (e.g. serialize/deserialize, I/O functions)
